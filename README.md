### Credit Card (CC) Fraud Detection: ###

• A 10-round iterative adversarial game simulating a GANs model

• The adversary generates fraud utilizing regression filtering and K_means clustering techniques

• The defender/ CC entity utilizes Reinforcement Learning, over-sampling, and cost-sensitive learning to train classifiers to detect the minority class (fraud)

• The defender and the adversary are pitted against each other in the 10-round game in order to optimize each of their performances

  
  
### FinTech: ###

• Re-classify customer credit risk to optimize solicitation rate and lower attrition (Random Forests and KNN models)

• Forecast portfolio cash flow and branch resource distribution (exponential moving average, SARIMA and Prophet models)

• A discrete-event simulation running at the portfolio and branch-level to predict new direct loans and live check cashings in dollar value (scikit-learn)
